 * A registry which collects information about NgModules, Directives, Components, and Pipes which

 * which summarize the compilation scope of a component.
 *
 * This class implements the logic of NgModule declarations, imports, and exports and can produce,
 * for a given component, the set of directives and pipes which are "visible" in that component's
 * template.
 *
 * The `LocalModuleScopeRegistry` has two "modes" of operation. During analysis, data for each
 * individual NgModule, Directive, Component, and Pipe is added to the registry. No attempt is made
 * to traverse or validate the NgModule graph (imports, exports, etc). After analysis, one of
 * `getScopeOfModule` or `getScopeForComponent` can be called, which traverses the NgModule graph
 * and applies the NgModule logic to generate a `LocalModuleScope`, the full scope for the given
 * module or component.
 *
 * The `LocalModuleScopeRegistry` is also capable of producing `ts.Diagnostic` errors when Angular
 * semantics are violated.
