/**
 * A Package is stored in a directory on disk and that directory can contain one or more package
 * formats - e.g. fesm2015, UMD, etc. Additionally, each package provides typings (`.d.ts` files).
 *
 * Each of these formats exposes one or more entry points, which are source files that need to be
 * parsed to identify the decorated exported classes that need to be analyzed and compiled by one or
 * more `DecoratorHandler` objects.
 *
 * Each entry point to a package is identified by a `package.json` which contains properties that
 * indicate what formatted bundles are accessible via this end-point.
 *
 * Each bundle is identified by a root `SourceFile` that can be parsed and analyzed to
 * identify classes that need to be transformed; and then finally rendered and written to disk.
 *
 * Along with the source files, the corresponding source maps (either inline or external) and
 * `.d.ts` files are transformed accordingly.
 *
 * - Flat file packages have all the classes in a single file.
 * - Other packages may re-export classes from other non-entry point files.
 * - Some formats may contain multiple "modules" in a single file.
