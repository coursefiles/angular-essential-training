## Course Description

Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building complex, single-page applications. This JavaScript platform provides a solid core of web functionality, letting you take care of the design and implementation details. In this course, Justin Schwartzenberger introduces you to the essentials of this "superheroic" platform, including powerful features such as two-way data binding, comprehensive routing, and dependency injection. Justin steps through the platform one feature at a time, focusing on the component-based architecture of Angular. Learn what Angular is and what it can do, as Justin builds a full-featured web app from start to finish. After mastering the essentials, you can tackle the other project-based courses in our library and create your own Angular app.

Topics include:
- What is Angular?
- Working with components
- Binding events and properties
- Getting data to components
- Using directives and pipes
- Creating Angular forms
- Validating form data
- How Angular does dependency injection
- Making HTTP calls
- Routing
- Styling components

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have these installed
  - [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [git](http://git-scm.com/)

2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) 

    `git clone https://github.com/coursefiles/angular-essential-training.git`
    
3. CD to the folder

    `cd angular-essential-training`

    and then fetch all of the remote branches for the repository
    
    `git fetch --all` 
    
4. Run the following to install the project dependencies:

    `npm install`
    
5. Run the ng serve command to build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally:

    `ng serve`

6. Navigate to http://localhost:4200. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

    `http://localhost:4200/`

The repository has a branch for each video starting point. For example, the branch **02-01b** is used as the starting code for the video *02-01 NgModule and the root module*. You can checkout branches using `git checkout <branchname>` and not have to re-run `npm install` each time since you will remain in the same root folder.
